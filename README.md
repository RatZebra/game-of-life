# game-of-life
Junior Year programming project for IB.

This project is a complete implementation of John Conway's cellular automaton, known commonly as the Game of Life. It was made in Java with WindowBuilder.

## Features
In addition to running any user specified starting simulation state, the grid size and simulation speed can also be modified. There is also the option to iterate through the simulation step by step.
